 A protocol defining a type of HLS playlist.

 if that's useful to you. `mamba` contains `MasterPlaylistType` and
 `VariantPlaylistType` flavors.

     If you are implementing your own playlist type, you should study
     "Master" and "Variant" implementations of this class very closely.
     Implementing this correctly is tricky. You should look very closely
     at `PlaylistCore` and it's `mutatingStructure` and usage of
     `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` as well. Consider using the common
     class `PlaylistStructureCore` as your base.
